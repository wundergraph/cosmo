# ADR - Router Custom Module System v1

- **Author:** Dustin Deus
- **Date:** 2025-05-15
- **Status:** Accepted
- **RFC:** ../rfcs/custom-modules-v1.md

## Abstract

This ADR describes an overhaul of the current module system in the router. The new module system is designed to be more flexible and native to GraphQL. It allows developers to hook into the router lifecycle as well as outgoing and incoming requests to subgraphs. The goal is to provide a clear API for developers to implement custom logic without having to understand the internal workings of the router or advanced Go programming concepts.

The new module system must be used to implement existing router features in a modular way. Only in that way, users can swap the implementation e.g. for metrics or tracing backends.

## Decision

A developer can implement a custom module by creating a struct that implements one or more of the following interfaces:

- RouterHooks: Provides hooks for the router lifecycle, including request and response handling.
  - `RouterRequestHook`: Called when a request is made to the router and after all GraphQL information is available.
  - `RouterResponseHook`: Called before the response is sent to the client. Allows for modifying the response before it is sent.
  - `RouterErrorHook`: Called when an error occurs during the router lifecycle. This hook is not coupled to a specific request.
- SubgraphHooks: Provides hooks for subgraph requests and responses.
  - `SubgraphRequestHook`: Called when a subgraph request is made.
  - `SubgraphResponseHook`: Called when a subgraph response is received.
- ApplicationHooks: Provides hooks for the application lifecycle, including startup, shutdown, and error handling.
  - `ApplicationStartHook`: Called when the application starts.
  - `ApplicationStopHook`: Called when the application stops.
  - `ApplicationErrorHook`: Called when an error occurs during the application lifecycle.
- GraphServerHooks: Provides hooks for the lifecycle of a GraphQL server. The GraphQL server is a unique federated graph that is created by the router.
  - `GraphServerStartHook`: Called when the GraphQL server starts e.g. for the first time or when the schema is updated.
  - `GraphServerStopHook`: Called when the GraphQL server stops e.g. when the application is shut down or the old schema is replaced.
- AuthenticationHooks: Provides hooks for authentication and authorization logic.
  - `AuthenticationHook`: Called when a router request is authenticated. This hooks should enable to skip and modify the authentication process.
- AuthorizationHooks: Provides hooks for authorization logic.
  - `AuthorizationHook`: Called when a router request is authorized. This hooks should enable to skip and modify the authorization process e.g. modifying scopes or permissions.
- TelemetryHooks: Provides hooks for native OpenTelemetry tracing and metrics.
  - `TelemetrySpanHook`: Called when a span is created. This hooks should enable to modify the span or add custom attributes or events.
  - `TelemetryMetricHook`: Called when a metric is recorded. This hooks should enable to modify the metric or add custom labels or values.
- OperationHooks: Provides hooks for parsing, normalization, validation, and planning GraphQL operations.
  - `OperationParseHook`: Called when an operation is parsed. It should be used to modify the operation before it is parsed.
  - `OperationNormalizeHook`: Called when an operation is normalized.
  - `OperationValidateHook`: Called when an operation is validated.
  - `OperationPlanHook`: Called when an operation is planned.
- OperationExecutionHooks: Provides hooks for the execution of a GraphQL operation.
  - `OperationExecutionHook`: Called when an operation is executed.
- `ModuleHooks` (**Required**): Provides hooks for the module lifecycle, including provisioning and shutdown.
  - `Provision`: Called when the module is provisioned.
  - `Shutdown`: Called when the module is shutdown.
  - `Module`: Returns the module information and factory function.

All hooks provide `pre/post` hooks. This allows developers to perform additional logic before or after the main hook has been executed. This is useful for custom telemetry, logging instrumentation, etc.

## Backwards Compatibility

The new module system is not backwards compatible with the old module system. Existing custom modules will need to be rewritten to use the new interfaces and API. We will provide a migration guide and tooling to help developers migrate their custom modules to the new system.

# Example Modules

__All examples are pseudocode and not tested, but they are as close as possible to the final implementation__

## Custom Telemetry

This module adds custom attributes to the OpenTelemetry span for each router request. Data can come from the request, the router configuration, or external sources. The example modifies the first span of the router but depending on the hook, the span is different.

```go
type MyModule struct{}

// Ensure that MyModule implements the RouterRequestHook interface
var _ RouterRequestHook = (*MyModule)(nil)

func (m *MyModule) OnRouterRequest(req *core.RouterRequest, err error) error {
	req.Telemetry.Span.AddEvent("Router Request")
	req.Telemetry.Span.AddAttributes(
		attribute.String("customer.id", "123"),
	)
	return nil
}
```

## Intercepting Router Responses

This module intercepts the final Router response to rewrite errors and add custom extensions. You have access to the parsed operation, the router request, and the router response.

```go
type MyModule struct{}

// Ensure that MyModule implements the RouterResponseHook interface
var _ RouterResponseHook = (*MyModule)(nil)

func (m *MyModule) OnRouterResponse(res *core.RouterResponse, err error) error {
	// Add custom extensions to the response
	res.Response.Extensions["myExtension"] = "myValue"

	// Rewrite errors in the response
	if len(res.Response.Errors) > 0 {
		for _, err := range res.Response.Errors {
			err.Message = "An error occurred"
		}
	}

	return nil
}
```

## Enriching logs

This module adds custom log fields to the router and subgraph logs. Data can come from the request, the response, or external sources. This will affect request and response logs.

```go
type MyModule struct{}

// Ensure that MyModule implements the RouterRequestHook interface
var _ RouterRequestHook = (*MyModule)(nil)

func (m *MyModule) OnRouterRequest(req *core.RouterRequest, err error) error {
    // Add custom fields to the router log
    req.Logger = req.Logger.With(zap.String("myField", "myValue"))
    
    return nil
}
```

## Custom service integration

This module integrates with Redis to cache responses from subgraphs. Useful for very specific use cases where caching is required.

```go
type MyModule struct{
	Redis *redis.Client
}

// Ensure that MyModule implements the SubgraphHooks interface
var _ SubgraphRequestHook = (*MyModule)(nil)
var _ SubgraphResponseHook = (*MyModule)(nil)

func (m *MyModule) Provision(ctx *core.ModuleContext) error {
    // Initialize the Redis client
    client := redis.NewClient(&redis.Options{
        Addr: "localhost:6379",
    })
    m.Redis = client
    return nil
}

func (m *MyModule) OnSubgraphRequest(req *core.SubgraphRequest, err error) error {
    // Check if the response is cached in Redis
    key := req.Request.Operation.Hash
    data, err := m.Redis.Get(key).Bytes()
    if err == nil {
        var response core.GraphQLResponse
        err := json.Unmarshal(data, &response)
        if err == nil {
            // Return the cached response
            req.Response = &response
            return nil
        }
    }
    return nil
}

func (m *MyModule) OnSubgraphResponse(res *core.SubgraphResponse, err error) error {
    // Cache the response in Redis
    key := res.Request.Operation.Hash
    data, err := json.Marshal(res.Response)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    m.Redis.Set(key, data, 24*time.Hour)
    return nil
}

func (m *MyModule) Cleanup() error {
    // Close the Redis client
    return m.Redis.Close()
}
```

## Custom Module configuration

Custom modules can be configured using a YAML file that is loaded by the router at startup `config.yaml`. We reserve a section in the configuration file for custom modules. Each module can have its own configuration section with custom properties.
The name of the module in the configuration file must match the name specified in the `ModuleInfo` struct.

```yaml
# config.yaml
modules:
  my_module:
    value: 42
```

At module provisioning, the configuration is loaded and is marshaled into the module struct, where it can be accessed across the module lifecycle. We support all primitive types, slices, and maps in the configuration file.

```go

type MyModule struct {
	Value uint64 `yaml:"value"`

	Nested struct {
		Property string `yaml:"property"`
	} `yaml:"nested"`
}

func (m *MyModule) Provision(ctx *core.ModuleContext) error {
	// Access the custom value from the configuration
	m.Value
}

func (m *MyModule) Module() core.ModuleInfo {
	return core.ModuleInfo{
		Name: "myModule",
		New:  func() core.Module {
            return &MyModule{}
        },
	}
}
```

## Custom Authentication and Authorization

Custom modules can be used to implement custom authentication and authorization logic in the router. The module can intercept incoming requests and validate the user's credentials, scopes, and permissions before forwarding the request to the subgraph. The router has built-in support for JWK. The parsed token information is available in the request `req.Request.Auth` field.

```go
type MyModule struct{}

var _ AuthenticationHook = (*MyModule)(nil)

func (m *MyModule) OnAuthenticate(req *core.RouterRequest, err error) error {
	// Authenticate the user's credentials
	if !authenticateUser(req.HttpRequest) {
		return core.UnauthenticatedError("Unauthenticated")
	}
	return nil
}

func (m *MyModule) OnAuthenticate(req *core.RouterRequest, err error) error {
  if !authorizeUser(req.Request.Auth) {
    return core.UnauthenticatedError("Unauthorized")
  }
  return nil
}
```

# Error Handling

Custom modules can return errors to the router. The router will handle the error and return a GraphQL error to the client. The module can return a custom error or a built-in error. Depending on the error, the router might expose the error to the client or not.

```go
func (m *MyModule) OnRouterRequest(req *core.RouterRequest, err error) error {
    // Validate request
    if !isValidRequest(req) {
        return core.ValidationError(
            "Invalid request format",
            WithExtension("invalidField", "email"),
            WithExtension("suggestion", "Use a valid email format"),
        )
    }
    return nil
}
```

# Advanced Modules

## Custom Subgraph Transport

Overwrite the subgraph transport to use a custom HTTP client with retries, mTLS, timeouts, and circuit breaking.

```go
type MyModule struct {
	Client *http.Client
}

func (m *MyModule) Provision(ctx *core.ModuleContext) error {
	// Register your custom HTTP client as the transport for subgraph requests
	// Can only be done in the provision method. If a second module tries to register a transport,
	// an error is returned because the behavior is undefined.
	
	ctx.RegisterOriginTransport(&http.Transport{})
	return nil
}
```

## React to specific GraphQL Directives

React to specific GraphQL directives in the subgraph schema and decide if the request should be forwarded to the subgraph. The following example checks if the `@requiresScopes` directive is present in the operation. Another example could be to check if the `@cacheControl` directive is present and set the cache control header on the response.

```go
type MyModule struct {
	Client *http.Client
}

func (m *MyModule) CacheControlDirectiveHandler(ctx *core.DirectiveContext) error {
	// Return an error to abort the request to the subgraph
	// The error is returned to the client as a GraphQL error

	// Find the minimum cache control directive in the operation to calculate the final cache time.
	// Finally, set the cache control header on the router response to the client in the OnRouterResponse hook.
	// The store is a shared context between all hooks and can be used to store and retrieve data.
	minAge := ctx.Directive.Args["maxAge"]
	currentAge := ctx.store.Get("cacheControl")
	if minAge < currentAge {
		ctx.store.Set("cacheControl", minAge)
	}

	return nil
}

func (m *MyModule) RequiresScopesDirectiveHandler(ctx *core.DirectiveContext) error {
	// Check if the user has the required scopes
	if !hasScopes(ctx.Request.Auth, ctx.Directive.Args["scopes"]) {
		return core.UnauthenticatedError("Unauthorized")
	}
	return nil
}

func (m *MyModule) Provision(ctx *core.ModuleContext) error {
	ctx.RegisterDirectiveHandler("cacheControl", m.CacheControlDirectiveHandler)
	ctx.RegisterDirectiveHandler("requiresScopes", m.RequiresScopesDirectiveHandler)
	return nil
}
```

## Validate GraphQL Scalar Types

GraphQL scalar types are meant to represent an indivisible value, like a string or an integer. Usually, a router can't validate the value of a scalar type because it's just a string. However, custom modules allows you to hook into the process before the value is sent to the subgraph and before it's sent to the client.
In our case, we ensure that the `Money` scalar type is a valid money format. We can validate the value of the scalar type in the `MoneyScalarHandler` hook and return an error if the value is invalid.

```go
type MyModule struct{}

func (m *MyModule) MoneyScalarHandler(ctx *core.ScalarContext) error {
	// Validate the Money scalar type
	if !isValidMoneyFormat(ctx.Value) {
		return core.ValidationError("Invalid money format")
	}
	return nil
}

func (m *MyModule) Provision(ctx *core.ModuleContext) error {
	ctx.RegisterScalarHandler("Money", m.MoneyScalarHandler)
	return nil
}
```


# Module Composition

Modules can be composed by chaining them together in the `Provision` method. This allows developers to create complex behavior by combining multiple modules which simplify testing and maintenance.
The order in which modules are composed determines the order in which they are executed. The submodules are executed first in the order they are registered, followed by the parent module.
Data from the parent module can be passed to the submodules as arguments in the constructor. Request and response data can be shared between modules using the request store.

```go
type MyModule struct{
	Value uint64 `yaml:"value"`
}

// Ensure that MyModule implements the RouterRequestHook interface
var _ RouterRequestHook = (*MyModule)(nil)

func (m *MyModule) Provision(ctx *core.ModuleContext) error {
	// Compose multiple modules together
	_ = ctx.RegisterModule(&ModuleB{
		value: m.Value,
	}, core.WithXyz("abc"))

	return nil
}

// ModuleB is a submodule of ModuleA

type ModuleB struct{
    value uint64
}

func (m *ModuleB) OnRouterRequest(req *core.RouterRequest, err error) error {
	// Access the parent module value
	m.value
	
	// Access the request store to share data between modules
	req.store.get("myData")

	return nil
}
```

# Module Registration

Modules are registered in the `main.go` file of the router application. The router will load the modules at startup and call the provision method to initialize them.
The order in which modules are registered determines the order in which they are executed. Modules are attached to a module registry. This registry needs to be set in the router before starting it.
In the example below, we use a singleton of the module registry to register the modules. For testing purposes, we will provide a way to create a new module registry and set it in the router. This allows for testing modules in isolation without affecting the global module registry.

```go
func main() {
	core.RegisterModule(&MyModule{}, core.WithXyz("abc"))

    // Start the router
    routercmd.Main()
}
```

Every custom router has its own `go.mod` file which represents in Go a module. This allows for reproducible builds and versioning of the custom router. The part below will be abstracted by a CLI tool in the future.
```go
// go.mod

module github.com/myorg/myrouter

go 1.23

require (
	"github.com/wundergraph/cosmo/router v0.93.0
	// Import your modules here
	github.com/myorg/mymodule v1.0.0
)
```

# Module Versioning

Modules can be versioned using standard go module versioning. The version of a module is specified in the `go.mod` file of the module. The router will load the correct version of the module based on the version specified in the `go.mod` file. The version of a module can be updated by changing the version in the `go.mod` file and running `go mod tidy` to update the dependencies.
Router modules should not behave differently as go modules are managed in the wild. It is also possible to not version the module at all.

```
.
├── modules/
│   ├── go.mod
│   └── myModule.go
└── router/
    ├── main.go
    └── go.mod
```

## Outlook

Possible workflow to implement and build custom modules:

1. **Scaffolding**: A CLI tool that scaffolds a new custom module with a template and basic structure.
2. **Testing**: A testing framework that provides utilities to test custom modules in isolation and in combination with other modules.
3. **Deployment**: A deployment tool that packages custom modules into a binary or container image and deploys them to the router.

```bash
wgc router new-module myModule --router v0.93.0 # Scaffold a new custom module and specify the router version
wgc router test # Run tests for all custom modules
wgc router build --image-tag myRouter # Build a custom module and package it into our official router image
```

### Terminology

- **Router**: The main entry point for incoming GraphQL requests. The router is responsible for routing requests to the appropriate subgraphs and aggregating the responses.
- **Subgraph**: A GraphQL service that provides a subset of the overall schema. Subgraphs are connected to the router and can be queried independently or as part of a federated query.
- **Operation**: A GraphQL operation that is sent to the router. An operation can be a query, mutation, or subscription.
- **Request**: A GraphQL request that is sent to the router. A request can contain an operation, variables, and extensions.
- **Response**: A GraphQL response that is sent from the router to the client. A response can contain data, errors, and extensions.
- **Hooks**: Functions that are called at specific points in the router lifecycle. Hooks can be used to intercept and modify requests and responses, handle errors, and perform custom logic.
- **Telemetry**: The collection of data related to the router and subgraph lifecycle. Telemetry can include metrics, traces, and logs. OpenTelemetry is used to collect telemetry data in the Router.
- **Application**: The overall router application that includes the router, subgraphs, and custom modules. The application lifecycle includes startup, shutdown, and error handling.
- **Module**: A custom extension that can be added to the router. Modules can implement hooks to interact with the router lifecycle and customize behavior.
