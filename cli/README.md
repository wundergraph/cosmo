## üöÄ What is `wgc`?

`wgc` is the official CLI for [WunderGraph Cosmo](https://cosmo-docs.wundergraph.com/), an open-source, full-lifecycle GraphQL API management platform.

With `wgc`, you can:

* Create and manage **federated GraphQL APIs** and **subgraphs**
* Perform **schema checks** and **composition validations**
* Generate and deploy **router configurations**
* Integrate with **CI/CD pipelines** for automated workflows
* Manage **namespaces**, **API keys**, and more

Whether you're building monolithic or federated GraphQL architectures, `wgc` provides the tools to manage your development and deployment processes.

## üß∞ Cosmo Features

* **Federation Support**: Compatible with GraphQL Federation v1 and v2
* **Schema Registry**: Centralized management of your GraphQL schemas with versioning and change tracking
* **Composition Checks**: Automated validation to ensure subgraphs compose correctly without breaking changes
* **Router Configuration**: Generate and manage router configurations for efficient query planning and execution
* **Observability**: Integrated with OpenTelemetry and Prometheus for metrics, tracing, and monitoring
* **Access Control**: Fine-grained access controls with support for OIDC, RBAC, and SCIM

## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v20 LTS or higher

### Install via npm

```bash
npm install -g wgc@latest
```

Or use `npx`:

```bash
npx -y wgc@latest
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Example Project

Start with the [Cosmo Demo](https://github.com/wundergraph/cosmo-demo), which includes two subgraphs (`posts` and `users`) and a router configuration.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wundergraph/cosmo-demo.git
cd cosmo-demo
```

### 2. Install `wgc`

Ensure you have `wgc` installed globally:

```bash
npm install -g wgc@latest
```

### 3. Start Subgraphs

Make the startup script executable and run it:

```bash
chmod +x start-subgraphs.sh
./start-subgraphs.sh
```

Verify the subgraphs are running:

* [Posts Subgraph](http://localhost:4001/graphql)
* [Users Subgraph](http://localhost:4002/graphql)

### 4. Generate Router Configuration

Navigate to the `router` directory and compose the router configuration:

```bash
cd router
wgc router compose --input graph.localhost.yaml --out config.json
```

### 5. Run the Router

Start the router using Docker:

```bash
docker run \
  --name cosmo-router \
  --rm \
  -p 3002:3002 \
  --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
  --platform=linux/amd64 \
  -e pull=always \
  -e DEV_MODE=true \
  -e LISTEN_ADDR=0.0.0.0:3002 \
  -e EXECUTION_CONFIG_FILE_PATH="/config/config.json" \
  -v "$(pwd)/config.json:/config/config.json" \
  ghcr.io/wundergraph/cosmo/router:latest
```

### 6. Query the Federated Graph

Access the federated GraphQL API at [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002).

Example query:

```graphql
query {
  posts {
    id
    content
    author {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

## üß™ Example Commands

* **Create Namespace**:

```bash
npx wgc namespace create production
```

* **Create Federated Graph**:

```bash
npx wgc federated-graph create main -r http://router.example.com/graphql -n production
```

* **Create Subgraph**:

```bash
npx wgc subgraph create products --routing-url http://localhost:4001/graphql
```

* **Check Subgraph Schema Changes**:

```bash
npx wgc subgraph check products -n production --schema ./schemas/products.graphql
```

* **Generate Router Configuration locally**:

Composition Configuration (graph.yaml):

```yaml
version: 1
subgraphs:
  - name: products
    routing_url: http://localhost:4001/graphql
    schema:
      file: ./schemas/products.graphql
```

Generate CMD:

```bash
npx wgc router compose -i graph.yaml -o config.json
```

* **Run Router**:

```bash
docker run \
  --name cosmo-router \
  --rm \
  -p 3002:3002 \
  --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
  --platform=linux/amd64 \
  -e pull=always \
  -e DEV_MODE=true \
  -e LISTEN_ADDR=0.0.0.0:3002 \
  -e EXECUTION_CONFIG_FILE_PATH="/config/config.json" \
  -v "$(pwd)/config.json:/config/config.json" \
  ghcr.io/wundergraph/cosmo/router:latest
```

## Telemetry

The CLI tool collects usage data to help us improve the tool and understand how users interact with it.
You can disable telemetry in one of the following ways:

```shell
export COSMO_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true
```

or

```shell
export DO_NOT_TRACK=1
```
