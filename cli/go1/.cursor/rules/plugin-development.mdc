# Go1 Plugin Development Guide

You are an expert in developing Cosmo Router plugins. You are given a GraphQL schema, and you need to implement the Go code for the plugin.
Your goal is to implement the plugin in a way that is easy to understand and maintain. You add tests to ensure the plugin works as expected.

All make commands need to be run from the plugin directory `/Users/milindadias/Work/cosmo/cli/go1`.

## Plugin Structure

A plugin is structured as follows:

```
plugins/go1/
├── Makefile                     # Build automation
├── go.mod                       # Go module definition
├── go.sum                       # Go module checksums
├── src/
│   ├── schema.graphql           # GraphQL schema (API contract)
│   ├── main.go                  # Plugin implementation
│   └── main_test.go             # Tests for the plugin
├── generated/                   # Auto-generated files (DO NOT EDIT)
│   ├── service.proto            # Generated Protocol Buffers
│   ├── service.pb.go            # Generated Go structures
│   ├── service.proto.lock.json  # Generated Protobuf lock file
│   └── service_grpc.pb.go       # Generated gRPC service
└── bin/                         # Compiled binaries
    └── plugin                   # The compiled plugin binary
```

## Development Workflow

1. When modifying the GraphQL schema in `src/schema.graphql`, you need to regenerate the code with `make generate`.
2. Look into the generated code in `generated/service.proto` and `generated/service.pb.go` to understand the updated API contract and service methods.
3. Implement the new RPC methods in `src/main.go`.
4. Add tests to `src/main_test.go` to ensure the plugin works as expected. You need to run `make test` to ensure the tests pass.
5. Finally, build the plugin with `make build` to ensure the plugin is working as expected.
6. Your job is done after successfully building the plugin. Don't verify if the binary was created. The build command will take care of that.

**Important**: Never manipulate the files inside `generated` directory yourself. Don't touch the `service.proto`,  `service.proto.lock.json`, `service.pb.go` and `service_grpc.pb.go` files.

You can update the Go dependencies by running `make test` to ensure the dependencies are up to date. It runs `go mod tidy` under the hood.

## Implementation Pattern

### Service Integration

If you need to integrate with other HTTP services, you should prefer to use the `github.com/wundergraph/cosmo/router-plugin/httpclient` package.
Always prefer a real integration over mocking. In the tests, you can mock the external service by bootstrapping an http server that returns the expected response.
In tests, focus on a well-defined contract and the expected behavior of your service. Structure tests by endpoint, use-cases and use table-driven tests when possible.

Here is an example of how to use the `httpclient` package:

```go
// Initialize HTTP client for external API calls
// The base URL is the URL of the external API
client := httpclient.New(
  httpclient.WithBaseURL("<replace_with_base_url>"),
  httpclient.WithTimeout(5*time.Second),
  httpclient.WithHeaders(map[string]string{}),
)
// A HTTP GET request to the external API
resp, err := client.Get(ctx, "/<replace_with_path>")
// A HTTP POST/PUT/DELETE request to the external API with a struct that is marshalled to JSON
resp, err := client.Post(ctx, "/<replace_with_path>", payload)
// Passing payload with custom request options
resp, err := client.Put(ctx, "/<replace_with_path>", payload,
  httpclient.WithHeaders(map[string]string{}),
)
// Unmarshal the JSON response into our data structure
data, err := httpclient.UnmarshalTo[[]ResponseType](resp)
// The response offers the following fields:
type Response struct {
	StatusCode int
	Headers    http.Header
	Body       []byte
}
// You can check for success (StatusCode >= 200 && StatusCode < 300)
resp.IsSuccess()
```
