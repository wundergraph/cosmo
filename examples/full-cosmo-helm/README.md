# Full Cosmo Helm

This example demonstrates how to run the entire Cosmo platform on Kubernetes with our official Helm chart. For demonstration purposes, we will use Minikube.

### Prerequisites

- A running Kubernetes cluster, with PV provisioner support + ingress controller
    - [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)
        - Requires enabling `minikube addons enable ingress`
- [Helm 3.2.0+](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) installed locally
- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) installed locally

## Getting started

### 1. Install the helm chart with the following command:

```shell
helm install cosmo oci://ghcr.io/wundergraph/cosmo/helm-charts/cosmo --version 0.8.0
```

_Check [Releases](https://github.com/wundergraph/cosmo/releases?q=helm-cosmo&expanded=true) for the latest release of the Cosmo Chart._

### 2. Make the Ingress controller accessible from your local machine.

The following steps depend on your operating system:

##### Linux

Minikube will automatically expose the ingress controller on your local machine. You can get the IP with `minikube ip`.
Now, add the following entries to your `/etc/hosts` file and replace the IP with the IP you get from the previous step.

```
192.168.49.2 studio.wundergraph.local
192.168.49.2 controlplane.wundergraph.local
192.168.49.2 router.wundergraph.local
192.168.49.2 keycloak.wundergraph.local
192.168.49.2 otelcollector.wundergraph.local
192.168.49.2 graphqlmetrics.wundergraph.local
192.168.49.2 cdn.wundergraph.local
```

##### macOS

Minikube needs to set up a tunnel to expose the ingress controller in your local machine. Add the following
entries to `/etc/hosts`:

```
127.0.0.1 studio.wundergraph.local
127.0.0.1 controlplane.wundergraph.local
127.0.0.1 router.wundergraph.local
127.0.0.1 keycloak.wundergraph.local
127.0.0.1 otelcollector.wundergraph.local
127.0.0.1 graphqlmetrics.wundergraph.local
127.0.0.1 cdn.wundergraph.local
```

Then start `minikube tunnel` and leave it running. It might ask for your root password in order to open
the tunnel on privileged ports.

### 3. Create Federated Graph Demo and Deploy the Router

The following command will create a federated graph consisting of multiple subgraphs and deploy the router to the minikube cluster.

```bash
./create_demo.sh
```

Finally ðŸš€, navigate to the [Studio Playground](http://studio.wundergraph.local/wundergraph/development/graph/mygraph/playground) and query the router.

Login with the default credentials:

```
Username: foo@wundergraph.com
Password: wunder@123
```

### 4. Clean up

After you are done, you can clean up the demo by running:

```bash
helm uninstall cosmo
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Volumes might not be automatically removed, so you may need to manually remove them with `kubectl delete pvc -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=cosmo`
