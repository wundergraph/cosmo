# Apollo Kotlin Client Router Tests

This folder contains a client test suite for the Apollo Kotlin library calling the cosmo router. This project is a kotlin project which uses gradle as the build tool, it uses the Apollo Kotlin library to generate the code for the graphql queries, and also run said queries.

To run the tests you can use the following command
```
./gradlew test
```

Unlike the JS library, the kotlin library is strict, as such it requires you to have the schema file and the queries
will be checked against the schema.

The schema can be found in the `src/main/graphql/schema.sdl` file, if you have made a schema change in the demo that needs to be reflected here the schema file should be updated with the latest demo schema

The graphql queries can be found in the `src/main/graphql/*.graphql` files, if you are adding a new graphql operation please create a new `*.graphql` file. Code will be autogenerated based on the graphql file, in order to do this you can run the following command
```
./gradlew generateApolloSources
```
