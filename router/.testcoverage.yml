# If specified, saves the current test coverage breakdown to this file.

  # Path to the test coverage breakdown file from the base branch.
  #
  # This file is usually generated and stored in the main (base) branch,
  # controlled via `breakdown-file-name` property.
  # When set in a feature branch, it allows the tool to compute and report 
  # the coverage difference between the current (feature) branch and the base.

  # between the feature branch and the base branch.

  # By default, this is disabled (set to null). Valid values range from 
  # -100.0 to +100.0.
  #
  # Example: 
  #   If set to 0.5, an error will be reported if the feature branch has 
  #   less than 0.5% more coverage than the base.
  #
  #   If set to -0.5, the check allows up to 0.5% less coverage than the base.
  threshold: null  # No threshold on coverage difference
